    "<p> In many dynamical systems it is often easiest to quantify the system as a differential equation, however, analytical solutions to such systems are often limited and we have to rely on numerical methods to solve the system. In order to understand numerical methods, we first must master the idea of discretization. <p>\n",

    "<p> If we think back to high school algebra, you might remember the concept of a function. Recall that a function $y = f(x)$ is a relationship between an independent variable $x$ and a dependent variable $y$. Often times when you plotted functions in high school, you used a graphing calculator and plugged in the function, for example $y=x^{2}$, and miraculously a plot of a parabola appeared on your screen! In our case we want to go back even further and think about when we plotted functions by hand. Often times you would create a table of values, plot the points, and then connect them to graph the function. The more points you had the smoother the plot would become. When you were plotting functions by hand you were discritizing the system. In numerical modeling we are going to do the same approach but for differential equations. But before we get there let's review discritization. </p>\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "Let us define the number of points as $N$ and the the grid spacing as $dx$. The grid, also sometimes called the mesh, is defined as the set of values of the dependent variable, which can be represented as the vector $\\vec{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}...x_{i}...x_{N})$. We then operate a function $f$ on our grid to get the dependent variable $\\vec{y} = (y_{1}, y_{2}...y_{i}...y_{N})$, which then allows us to plot the function. \n",
